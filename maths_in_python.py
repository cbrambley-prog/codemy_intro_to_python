This script experiements with maths in Python.

The first section covers basic operators
'''

print(3+2) # addition

print(100-88) # subraction

print(9*9) # multiplications

print (9**2) # exponent

print(10/5) # division, this outputs a float

print(10//5) # this is called floor division and outputs an integer

print(10%3) # modulus... I don't know what to expect from this

# Now we're going to output calculations as part of  a string

print(f"This is an f string, we're going to embed 2 squared, which will output 2**2 = {2**2}") # an f string

'''
The next section covers comparison operators
'''

print(f"Does 2 equal 5? Answer: {2==5}") # equal to

print(f"Does 3 not equal 5? Answer: {3!=5}") # not equal to

print(f"Is 3 great than 3? Answer: {3>3}") # greater than

print(f"Is 3 greater than to equal to 3? Answer: {3>=3}") # greater than to equal to

print(f"Is 98 less than 110? Answer: {98<110}") # less than

print(f"Is 98 less than to equal to 110? Answer: {98<=110}") # less than to equal to
